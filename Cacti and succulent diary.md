### August 2021

#### 28.: new cacti arrivals

1. Espostoa sp.  
![](attachments/Clipboard_2021-08-28-18-05-30.png)  
Quick and dirty cleaned roots (I use old toothbrush) and put into the standard mix (1/3 sand 1-2mm, 1/3 standard plant soil, 1/3 cactus soil, take out larger wood/bark pieces, top and bottom 6-8mm stones). Since we do not have a lot of sun and it is well protected, put it on the south window right away, a little behind bigger pots.  
Note: sources say this species will not reach flowering maturity in pot.

2. Coryphantha sp. (potosiana?)  
![](attachments/Clipboard_2021-08-28-18-06-38.png)  
The poor plant lost all the smaller roots (next time look at the top of the soil, it had grey-blueish color). My first cactus with tuberous root! For now it goes for 1 week into Vogelsand ([super rooting tip from Kakteenforum](https://www.kakteenforum.de/showthread.php?8532-Sicher-und-schnell-bewurzeln!-TIPP!!)), and away from sunlight, after that I have to think of a good soil mix. Haage says it should have clay which I still could not get my hands on.  

Note: now I have looked at both genus' species, I am quite convinced that two of the cacti I have got form the same source before also belong to those. A columnar one looks like [Espostoa calva](https://cactiguide.com/cactus/?genus=Espostoa&species=calva) (another name [Thrixanthocereus jelenkyanus](http://tonthat.50webs.com/Gia%20dinh/Columnar-cacti/index-55.html)). And the one with tubercles which I was not sure if it was a Mammillaria, might be [Coryphantha](https://cactiguide.com/cactus/?genus=Coryphantha), looks similar to georgii or maiz-tablasensis. One feature that it also has are grooves on the tubercles.

Note: add [Cipocereus](https://cactiguide.com/cactus/?genus=Cipocereus) to the wishlist, it has blue berries!
