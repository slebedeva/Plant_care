| Amaryllis ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-03-21-09-33-13.png) | South Africa (forest) https://www.mein-schoener-garten.de/gartenpraxis/indoor/amaryllis-verblueht-was-tun-34631In summer should be outside (no direct sunlight) and will go into sleep in August. Don't use very big pot, if it has many small bulbs it will not bloom. For sleep 2-3mo. should be dark and cool (10-15 degrees - I guess balcony would still work hm). November take it inside and start watering, lots of light needed. Important : water only from below, better too dry than too wet! Think dry and rain season in Africa.| Winter: inside south, Summer: outside north | Spring | 
|Alocasia|South-East Asia. It needs a lot of warmth and watering but the soil should be like for orchids so that water can come through. And it needs warm distilled water. (Mine has lost all leaves so trying to rescue it by replacing into such soil, putting the bag around and waiting till it is warm...) Think tropical rainforest. No direct sunlight too. And roots can rot really easily too. | Inside south | Spring :+1:|
| Ananas | how-to : I failed to root tops, many times, they all rot, in water and in soil, even if roots are already visible( If try again do it in summer so that fruits are not too cold. Have seeds, try to get them into over 30 degrees and highly humid and after 1mo. they might sprout. | | | 
| Anthurium | Central and South America. Soil for aroid plants. Needs spraying. Medium light. Warm. Small pot stimulates flowering. https://rastenievod.com/anturium.html. Trips. | Inside south, away from window | Spring :+1: | 
| Banana | SE Asia, India. https://flowertimes.ru/banan/ Lots of light and direct sunlight. High humidity and high water consumption. Warmth. Grows like crazy! Younglings dry easily and eaten by trips. Adult leaves they cannot pierce likely, so clean. | South inside | Spring | 
| Bergpalme (Chamaedorea elegans) | Mexico. https://www.mein-schoener-garten.de/pflanzen/bergpalmen/bergpalme Shade. Soil with sand. Cannot dry out! But water should drain easily. Does not need fertilizer 1 year after repotting. Spray in summer essential. Spinnmilbe, Blattläuse. | Spring :+1: | North inside | 
| Chilli | Light. Insect magnet especially in winter when brought inside. Aphids and trips. Older plants give more but I often lose them in winter... | Summer outside north, Winter inside south | Spring | 
| Chlorophytum | America, S. Africa, subtropical near rivers. Likes spraying and moist (not too much though). Aerial light substrate is important! And fertilizer. Mine died for unknown reason (leaves started to rot from the root, decresing moisture did not help) | North inside | Spring | 
| Codiaeum (кротон) | Pacific islands. Молочай. Яд! Если опадают листья, нужно пересадить, много удобрений, высокая влажность. Прищипать верхушку. Обязательно поливать тёплой водой, не допускать пересызание. Много рассеянного света, летом можно на улицу. Spinnmilbe. | South inside | :+1: Spring  |
| Coffee arabica Nana | Winter high light, summer no direct sunlight, over 16C outside (in nature it is under trees so north balcony was good). Spraying good (not when in bloom). Soil acidic and light. Fertilizer. Cutting is stressful, but old tree could be cut on top and rooted again.  Needs deep pot because of the central root. Seeds should be planted right away if wanted. It actually should be 1 plant per pot. https://www.vogorodah.ru/vyrashhivanie-kofe-doma/ | Winter: South inside, Summer: North outside | :+1: Spring |
| Crocus | Saffran family. Needs sandy high pH soil and sunny place (mine rotted in March showers). |  
| Dracaena lucky bamboo | Cameroon . No direct sunlight, high humidity. High temperature. Trips can eat leaves. I rooted a sprout but it is not very spectacular. Original plant is in water with a drop of fertilizer and is neither dying nor growing. | North inside | Change water |
| Dracaena | No direct sunlight, warm. Spraying fine. Water only when dry. | North inside | | 
| Fatsia | Japan. https://rastenievod.com/fatsiya.html Much light, not direct sunlight, should not dry out, lots of fertilizer. Trips can eat it. | North inside (using lamp) in winter, outside summer | | 
| Ficus elastica (Gummibaum) | India, Java. Half shade OK. No direct sunlight. Not under 15C. Water only after dry. Spraying. Trips can eat leaves. | North inside | | 
| Lichi ( seeds ) | will sprout in warm condition but die later. | | | 
| Mango (seeds) | will sprout in warm condition but die later. |||
| Monstera | Central America forest. No direct sunlight but does need quite some light. Needs big support. Careful with aerial roots. Needs spraying. Winter south side OK, summer move it to the back. Trips. Well draining soil. | Winter south inside window, summer south away from the window | :+1: Spring | 
| Peperomia orba | Better drier than too wet! No direct sunlight but a lot of light. Needs regular cutting, cuttings root very easily in water. https://rastenievod.com/peperomiya.html | North inside | Renew the plant regulary |
| Phalaenopsis | https://orchidsworld.com.ua/blog/uhod/ukhod-za-orkhideyey-v-raznyye-pory-goda why roots rot: less light (Fall) so less evaporation so no water movement! https://orchidsworld.com.ua/blog/problems-with-the-roots/gniyut-korniMuch less water in winter, never direct sunlight but at least 10-12h light day, fertilize in spring, possible to be outside in summer (night >15C) but watch out for pests! if there are small insects means too wet and rotten parts inside | North inside (with lamp) | Check roots regularly for rotting | 
| Pilea depressa | Caribbean. https://pflanzio.de/pilea-depressa/https://floral-city.ru/pilea-pileya.htmlNo direct sunlight! Bright shade. Watering normal, not too wet. Drainable soil. Not under 15C. Roots super easily (1 node is enough). Probably needs renewing. If losing leaves probably too cold+too wet or too dark. Trips. | South inside shade | |
| Poincettia Xmas star | Mexico. http://myflo.ru/catalog/puansetija/rozhdestvenskij_cvetok_puansetija_uhod_v_domashnih_uslovijah Needs water but not too wet! Either over drying or over wetting kills it. Needs regular cutting. Cuttings are hard to root (never worked for me). After blooming needs 2 mo. of rest (14 degrees, less water). To have it bloom by Xmas just keep it at natural light day in Northern window after bringing it inside in fall. For me bedroom worked since we hardly use artificial light in the evening there. Soil needs to be well drained and slightly acidic. | :+1: Spring (after bloom) | South inside. | 
| Spathiphyllum | Brasil, Philippines. Not under +10! (winter take it to the living room), lots of light, south side! High humidity. Too large pot will stimulate sprouts and less flowers. | South inside (bathroom) | :+1: Spring, When necessary |
|Zamioculcas | Africa. Lot of light, can tolerate direct sunlight. Watering only after dry! Some fertilizer, spraying in summer is OK. https://rastenievod.com/zamiokulkas.html It grows really slowly! I had a leaf from Li, it took 1 year to make a tuber and another year to make the first new leaf with 2 leaflets only. Be patient :-) | South inside | Spring/Summer/Only when necessary |
