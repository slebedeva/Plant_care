# Banana
Root rot. Watered in summer in the sun a lot, it grew very much, and at some points saw small white insects (springtail). These are your friends since they indicate overwatering. Unfortunately when you see them it may be too late. Repotting did not help, mother plant died. Currently I have 2 babies in wet bird sand (it is a tip from cactus people, has anis that desinfects) trying to get them recover roots. Maybe they will be saved.

# Begonia
Mine was an UFO-kind with red middle, pretty. It just lost all leaves and dried for no reason.

# Calla
I plainly forgot the bulbs in the pot outside and 1 week of -10 killed it (last winter was milder so the bulbs survived no problem).
Same goes for other spring bulbs. Our winters are so warm that they sprout very early, January or so, and bulbs are only frost hardy in dormant state. So a week of late February frost killed them all, narcisses, crocus, iris, tulip, hyacinthes.

# Xmas tree (Picea glauca)
Spider mite

# Christrose (Helleborus niger)
Over- as well as under-watering, also spider mites.

# Poincettia Xmas star
Several died in my hands, some by overwatering, some by overdrying. It is quite difficult to keep water balance, single mistake brings them over the edge quickly.

# Petunia
Mildew, need to be careful with watering.

# Strawberry
Spider mite. Same for brumbleberry.

# Sunflower
Miner fly (horrible beast!)

# Wine grape
No apparent reason. It had buds this spring, which then stopped developing and fell off. Previous several years it gave friut despite being in a pot.
